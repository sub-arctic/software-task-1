class RigidBody:
    """A class representing a rigid body in a physics simulation.

    A rigidbody is a two dimensional shape that has rigid physics;
    it's edges are 'strong' and cannot break. This is MUCH simpler
    to work with than soft body objects.

    Restitution is the elasticity coefficient. 0 is completely inelastic,
    and 1 is perfectly elastic. It determines the collision response between
    two RigidBodies.

    Attributes:
        vertices: The vertices of the body.
        position: The current position of the body.
        velocity: The current velocity of the body.
        angle: The current rotation angle of the body in radians.
        mass: The mass of the body.
        restitution: The restitution coefficient of the body.
        moment_of_inertia: The moment of inertia of the body.
        angular_velocity: The current angular velocity of the body.
        force: The accumulated force applied to the body.
        torque: The accumulated torque applied to the body.
        pinned: Indicates whether the body is pinned in place.
