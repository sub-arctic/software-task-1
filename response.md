Here’s one way to think about splitting up the class: you can decompose it based on distinct responsibilities—namely, simulation control, rendering, and event handling. Below is an outline of one approach:

---

### 1. Identify Responsibilities

- **Simulation Control:**  
  Manage the simulation’s state (play/pause, stepping through time, interfacing with the physics engine).

- **Rendering:**  
  Handle all drawing operations (drawing shapes, updating positions, drawing vector arrows, etc.).

- **Event Handling:**  
  Process user interactions (mouse press, drag, release) and delegate them appropriately.

---

### 2. Proposed Classes

- **`SimulationCanvas` (View Component):**  
  This class remains a subclass of `tk.Canvas` but now serves mainly as the “view” layer. It holds instances of the controller, renderer, and event handler, and wires them together. Its job is to create and update the canvas and delegate tasks.

- **`SimulationController`:**  
  Encapsulate the simulation logic. This class manages the simulation state (running or paused), calls the physics engine’s update methods, and schedules simulation steps. It acts as the bridge between the model (physics engine) and the view.

- **`BodyRenderer`:**  
  Focus solely on drawing bodies and visual elements. It contains methods such as `draw_square`, `draw_polygon`, `update_bodies`, `draw_vector_lines`, and any helper methods for cleaning up (like `clean_force_arrows`).

- **`InteractionManager`:**  
  Handle user events (e.g., `body_press`, `body_drag_motion`, `body_drag_release`). This class interprets the mouse events and interacts with both the simulation controller (to update state) and renderer (to update visuals) as needed.

### 3. Example Refactoring Outline

Below is a simplified pseudo-code example of how you might structure the refactored code:

```python
# simulation_canvas.py
class SimulationCanvas(tk.Canvas):
    def __init__(self, parent):
        super().__init__(parent, background="black")
        self.parent = parent
        self.update_dimensions()

        # Create the separate components
        self.renderer = BodyRenderer(self)
        self.simulation_controller = SimulationController(self)
        self.interaction_manager = InteractionManager(self, self.simulation_controller)

        # Bind events through the interaction manager
        self.tag_bind("body", "<ButtonPress-1>", self.interaction_manager.body_press)
        self.tag_bind("body", "<B1-Motion>", self.interaction_manager.body_drag_motion)
        self.tag_bind("body", "<ButtonRelease-1>", self.interaction_manager.body_drag_release)

    def update_dimensions(self):
        self.canvas_width = self.winfo_width()
        self.canvas_height = self.winfo_height()
```

```python
# simulation_controller.py
class SimulationController:
    def __init__(self, canvas):
        self.canvas = canvas
        self.simulation_running = False
        self.physics_engine = physics.PhysicsEngine()
        self.speed_factor = 2

    def play_pause_simulation(self):
        if self.simulation_running:
            self.simulation_running = False
            self.canvas.parent.play_pause_text.set("Play")
        else:
            self.simulation_running = True
            self.canvas.parent.play_pause_text.set("Pause")
            self.step_simulation()

    def step_simulation(self, dt=0.016):
        scaled_dt = dt * self.speed_factor
        self.canvas.update_dimensions()
        self.physics_engine.update(scaled_dt, self.canvas.canvas_width, self.canvas.canvas_height)
        if self.simulation_running:
            self.canvas.update()  # update canvas elements
            self.canvas.parent.after(int(dt * 1000 / self.speed_factor), self.step_simulation)
            self.canvas.parent.properties_frame.update_properties()
            self.canvas.renderer.draw_vector_lines()
```

```python
# body_renderer.py
class BodyRenderer:
    def __init__(self, canvas):
        self.canvas = canvas

    def draw_square(self):
        square = drawing.draw_square(200, 100, 100, 100)
        polygon_id = self.draw_polygon(square.get_vertices(), outline="white")
        self.canvas.simulation_controller.physics_engine.add_rigid_body(square, polygon_id)

    def draw_polygon(self, vertices, *args, **kwargs):
        # Use a method to generate unique tags as needed
        tags = ("body", "unique_body_tag")
        return self.canvas.create_polygon(*vertices, tags=tags, *args, **kwargs)

    def update_bodies(self):
        bodies = self.canvas.simulation_controller.physics_engine.get_bodies()
        for body_id, body in bodies.items():
            vertices = []
            for vec in body.get_corners():
                vertices.extend([vec.x, vec.y])
            self.canvas.coords(body_id, *vertices)

    def draw_vector_lines(self):
        # Implement the vector drawing similar to your original code
        pass

    def clean_force_arrows(self):
        self.canvas.delete("vec_line")
```

```python
# interaction_manager.py
class InteractionManager:
    def __init__(self, canvas, simulation_controller):
        self.canvas = canvas
        self.simulation_controller = simulation_controller
        self.mouse_positions = physics.DataPointList(2)

    def body_press(self, event):
        self.pressed_body_id = self.canvas.find_withtag("current")[0]
        self.current_body = self.simulation_controller.physics_engine.get_body(self.pressed_body_id)
        self.canvas.itemconfigure(self.pressed_body_id, dash=(3, 5))

    def body_drag_motion(self, event):
        self.current_body = self.simulation_controller.physics_engine.get_body(self.pressed_body_id)
        if self.current_body is None:
            return
        new_position = physics.Vector2D(event.x, event.y)
        new_velocity = physics.Vector2D(0, 0)
        self.current_body.move(new_position, new_velocity)
        time_ = time.perf_counter_ns()
        self.mouse_positions.add_data_point(time_, new_position)

    def body_drag_release(self, event):
        new_velocity = physics.calculate_velocity(self.mouse_positions)
        if self.current_body is None:
            return
        self.current_body.move(velocity=new_velocity)
        self.canvas.itemconfigure(self.pressed_body_id, dash=())
```

### 4. Benefits of This Approach

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each class has a well-defined responsibility. For example, if you need to change how bodies are drawn, you only have to modify the `BodyRenderer` class.
- **Easier Testing and Maintenance:** With distinct modules, you can test the simulation logic, rendering, and event handling independently.
- **Improved Readability:** Future developers (or yourself) can more easily understand and modify the code because each part is self-contained.

This refactoring approach is just one of many possible strategies. Depending on the project’s complexity and future requirements, you might choose to further refine these boundaries or merge some responsibilities.
