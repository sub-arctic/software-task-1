# Introduction
Welcome to the Physics Simulator!

In this application, you will learn about:
- Newton's Laws
- Gravity
- Collision Physics

Use the dropdown at the bottom of the page to switch between lessons.
In each lesson, you may drag around objects in the canvas with the left mouse button.
Right clicking on an object will "freeze" it in place.

The simulation can be started and stopped using the button.

Try playing around with the simulation on the right!
