# Newton's Second Law of Motion

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the
net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to its mass.

# Equation
$F = ma$

Where:
- F is the force applied
- m is the mass of the object
- a is the acceleration

# Demo
- Apply a force to the object and adjust its mass to see the effect on acceleration.
