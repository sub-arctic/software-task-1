# Gravity
Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward each other.

## Effects of Gravity
- Objects fall towards Earth
- Determines weight
- Affects planetary orbits

## Equation
$g = 9.81 \, m/s^2$


- Where 9.81 is the gravity of earth.
- The gravity of the moon is about 16% of earth's.

# Weight
The relative weight of an object is typically measured in kilograms.

It is given by the formula

$w = mg$

Where:
- m is the objects mass (typically in newtons, N) 
- g is the gravity
